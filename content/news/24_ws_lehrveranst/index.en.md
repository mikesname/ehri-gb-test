During the winter semester, two EHRI-AT partner institutions, the Leopold-Franzens University of Innsbruck and the Centre for Jewish Studies at the Karl-Franzens University of Graz (CSJ), are  integrating EHRI content into their courses. In the contemporary history seminar led by Eva Pfanzelter, ‘Holocaust digital. Victim/perpetrator research, digital tracing, virtual culture of remembrance and social media campaigns’ , EHRI course units on tools and methods of digital Holocaust research are held. In his course ‘Literary Representations of Destruction and Violence’, Olaf Terpitz (CJS) not only teaches different documentation and narrative methods, but also combines this content with presentations on digital services such as the EHRI online editions. The seminar ‘Writing History’, organised by Gerald Lamprecht (CJS), introduces students to digital methods in historical studies. The courses are held with the participation of VWI employees Ines Koeltzsch, Éva Kovács and Marianne Windsperger as well as Injoest employee Benjamin Grilj.
